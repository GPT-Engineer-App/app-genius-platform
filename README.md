# app-genius-platform

An app creation platform designed to educate and assist users in building their own applications. This platform will feature comprehensive tutorials across various fields, such as web and app development, guiding users through creating simple projects. It will introduce programming languages, their roles, file management, and other foundational concepts through interactive ChatGPT sessions. After completing tutorials, users can embark on designing and developing their own projects, with the option to impose language restrictions for learning purposes. The platform will require visualization features for code, similar to Progate, allowing users to see the impact of their work in real time. Support will be available for users needing assistance during development. Finally, the platform will facilitate the release of completed projects, handled by the platform's team.
